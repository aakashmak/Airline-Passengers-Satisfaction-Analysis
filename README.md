## Description

I analyzed an Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset to identify key factors contributing to a recent dip in customer satisfaction rates. This involved designing a Power BI dashboard report and recommending a data-driven strategy to boost overall satisfaction. The project's insights enabled the airline to take targeted actions, improving customer satisfaction and enhancing the travel experience for passengers.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

KPIs are measurable values that organizations use to track and evaluate their progress towards achieving specific business objectives. They are used to measure performance over time and allow organizations to make data-driven decisions based on actual results. KPIs are specific to the objectives of an organization or department and can be qualitative or quantitative. They are important metrics that help organizations identify areas for improvement, set targets for future performance, and track their success in meeting their goals.

## KPIs that were calculated:

•	**Total Passengers:** The total number of passengers included in the dataset.

•	**Percentage Male Passengers**: The percentage of male passengers included in the dataset.

•	**Percentage Female Passengers:** The percentage of female passengers included in the dataset.

•	**Percentage First-time Customers:** The percentage of passengers who are flying with the airline for the first time.

•	**Percentage Returning Customers**: The percentage of passengers who have flown with the airline before.

•	**Percentage First-time Male Customers**: The percentage of male passengers who are flying with the airline for the first time.

•	**Percentage First-time Female Customers**: The percentage of female passengers who are flying with the airline for the first time.

•	**Percentage Returning Male Customers**: The percentage of male passengers who have flown with the airline before.

•	**Percentage Returning Female Customers**: The percentage of female passengers who have flown with the airline before.

•	**Average Arrival Delay**: The average amount of time that flights are delayed upon arrival, calculated in minutes.

•**Average Departure Delay**: The average amount of time that flights are delayed upon departure, calculated in minutes.

•	**Average Flight Distance**: The average distance travelled by flights, calculated in miles.

•	**Total Business Travel Customers**: The total number of passengers who are travelling for business purposes.

•	**Total Personal Travel Customers**: The total number of passengers who are travelling for personal reasons.

•	**Total Satisfied Customers**: The total number of passengers who reported being satisfied with their flight experience.

•	**Total Dissatisfied Customers**: The total number of passengers who reported being neutral or dissatisfied with their flight experience.

•	**Satisfaction Rate**: The percentage of passengers who reported being satisfied with their flight experience, calculated as the ratio of Total Satisfied Customers to Total Passengers
Satisfaction Rate = (Total Satisfied Customers / Total Passengers) x 100%

•	**Dissatisfaction Rate**: The percentage of passengers who reported being neutral or dissatisfied with their flight experience, calculated as the ratio of Total Dissatisfied Customers to Total Passengers.
Dissatisfaction Rate = (Total Dissatisfied Customers / Total Passengers) x 100%
